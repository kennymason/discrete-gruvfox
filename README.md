# Discrete Gruvfox
A Dark Gruvbox theme for Firefox that offers "Private Browsing Only" styling.

## Private-Browsing-Only
This repo contains two copies of the theme - one that modifies your entire browser profile, and one that only applies in Private Browsing windows.

The setup for each is identical, which you can read about in the 'chrome Folder' section below.

## chrome Folder
This is not a theme you can add in your browser settings under 'Themes'. Instead, it's implemented using `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` files. 

These need to be added to a `chrome` folder in your local profile directory.
